This is the accompanying code sample to my step-by-step article on how to use the Office 365 SDK in iOS. It's very basic code that I slapped together in a very short amount of time, and is meant to be a quick demo, nothing more. I know it probably contains bad coding conventions and confusing UI- again, its just meant to show you how the API calls work in Swift.

 Use however you wish. No attribution necessary.
